<p style="color:white">The Big Bang Model is a broadly accepted theory for the origin and evolution of our universe. 
It postulates that 12 to 14 billion years ago, the portion of the universe we can see today was only a few millimeters
across. It has since expanded from this hot dense state into the vast and much cooler cosmos we currently inhabit.
We can see remnants of this hot dense matter as the now very cold cosmic microwave background radiation which still
The Big Bang Model is supported by a number of important observations, each of which are described in more detail on
 separate pages:
Edwin Hubble's 1929 observation that galaxies were generally receding from us provided the first clue that the Big Bang
 theory might be right.
The abundance of the light elements H, He, Li
The Big Bang theory predicts that these light elements should have been fused from protons and neutrons in the first few
 minutes after the Big Bang.
The cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation
The early universe should have been very hot. The cosmic microwave background radiation is the remnant heat leftover from
 the Big Bang.
These three measurable signatures strongly support the notion that the universe evolved from a dense, nearly featureless 
hot gas, just as the Big Bang model predicts.

<h3><ul><li><p style="color:white">Tests of Big Bang Cosmology</li></ul></h3><br>
   <p style="color:white">The Big Bang model of cosmology rests on two key ideas that date back to the early 20th century: General Relativity and the Cosmological
 Principle. By assuming that the matter in the universe is distributed uniformly on the largest scales, one can use General Relativity to
  compute the corresponding gravitational effects of that matter. Since gravity is a property of space-time in General Relativity, this is
   equivalent to computing the dynamics of space-time itself. The story unfolds as follows:<br>
Given the assumption that the matter in the universe is homogeneous and isotropic (The Cosmological Principle) it can be shown that the
 corresponding distortion of space-time (due to the gravitational effects of this matter) can only have one of three forms, as shown 
 schematically in the picture at left. It can be "positively" curved like the surface of a ball and finite in extent; it can be "negatively"
 curved like a saddle and infinite in extent; or it can be "flat" and infinite in extent - our "ordinary" conception of space. A key limitation
  of the picture shown here is that we can only portray the curvature of a 2-dimensional plane of an actual 3-dimensional space! Note that in a
   closed universe you could start a journey off in one direction and, if allowed enough time, ultimately return to your starting point; in an
    infinite universe, you would never return.<br><br>


    Before we discuss which of these three pictures describe our universe (if any) we must make a few disclaimers:

<p style="color:white">Because the universe has a finite age (~13.77 billion years) we can only see a finite distance
    out into space: ~13.77 billion light years.
 This is our so-called horizon. The Big Bang Model does not attempt to describe that region of space significantly beyond our
  horizon - space-time could well be quite different out there.
It is possible that the universe has a more complicated global topology than that which is portrayed here, while still having the same local 
curvature. For example it could have the shape of a torus (doughnut). There may be some ways to test this idea, but most of the following 
discussion is unaffected.
Matter plays a central role in cosmology. It turns out that the average density of matter uniquely determines the geometry of the universe
 (up to the limitations noted above). If the density of matter is less than the so-called critical density, the universe is open and infinite.
  If the density is greater than the critical density the universe is closed and finite. If the density just equals the critical density,
   the universe is flat, but still presumably infinite. The value of the critical density is very small: it corresponds to roughly 6 hydrogen
    atoms per cubic meter, an astonishingly good vacuum by terrestrial standards! One of the key scientific questions in cosmology today is:
     what is the average density of matter in our universe? While the answer is not yet known for certain, it appears to be tantalizingly close 
     to the critical density.
